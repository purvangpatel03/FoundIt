# FoundIt

Developed Foundit, a Flutter-based mobile application that empowers users to reunite with lost items in their local vicinity.

This user-friendly app facilitates account creation, lost/found item posting, and in-app chat functionality to connect users directly.

Leveraging Firebase, Foundit ensures secure storage of user data, item details, chat history, and accompanying photos, fostering a seamless and collaborative lost-and- found experience.
